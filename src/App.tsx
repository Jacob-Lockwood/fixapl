              all functions can be called with either one argument or two
              arguments (known as monadic and dyadic calls), though some
              functions are only defined to have meaning for one or the other.

              In FIXAPL, this is not the case; every function has only a single
              way to be called, and this is ingrained into the syntax. This is
              referred to as <i>fixed-arity</i>.

                  The overloading of glyphs to have different meanings when
                  called monadically versus dyadically can be confusing. This is
                  not universally true, and many glyph-pairings just feel
                  natural, but others don't. Marshall Lochbaum has written about

                  In Uiua, functions having fixed arity lets modifiers have
                  different behavior depending on the arities of their operands,
                  which is very useful in many situations. In APL and the like,
                  this is just impossible, and the best they can do is
                  overloading the resulting function to have different meaning
                  if it is called monadically or dyadically, which is far more
                  limited.

                  Traditionally, trains are composed of many sequential fork

                  represents G called with the results of F and H applied to the
                  function's arguments. But what if you want to include monadic
                  function applications within a train? This is a very common
                  want, but the fork-based train construction provides no clear
                  solution. Language designers have noticed this and attempted
                  to remedy it: J's cap <code class="bg-black/30 px-1">[:</code>{" "}
                  and BQN's Nothing <code class="bg-black/30 px-1">Â·</code>{" "}
                  offer a concise way to insert an atop into a train, while Kap
                  chooses to replace fork-trains with trains made solely of
                  atops and have a special syntax for forks.

                  Making functions have fixed arity actually provides a very
                  elegant solution to this problem, without needing any extra
                  syntax. Instead of breaking expressions into only forks, the
                  expression can be broken into forks, atops, even hooks, based
                  entirely on the arity of the tines. Examples of this can be
                  found in the language reference on this page. Another nice
                  consequence of this is that a train may have a value as its
                  rightmost tine and still resolve to a function rather than a
                  value.
