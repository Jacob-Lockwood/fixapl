# FIXAPL

This site is intended to demonstrate what an APL-family language might look and feel like if re-imagined with fixed arity functions all the way down. It's not supposed to be a complete or production-ready language, but I want it to have enough features that one can use it and understand how its concepts might fit into a larger program.

This is still in development. Most of the language has been implemented, but there are still some primitives and other features which are planned, and there are no docs available yet.
