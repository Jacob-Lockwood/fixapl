# Fixed Arity APL

This site is intended to demonstrate what an APL-family language might look and feel like if re-imagined with fixed arity functions all the way down. It's not supposed to be a complete or production-ready language, but I want it to have enough features that one can use it and understand how its concepts might fit into a larger program.

This is still in development; currently, most of the base language works and a few primitives, but there's still work that needs to be done. I intend to implement probably twenty more primitives.
